# Implementing Fishing Rod Line Physics in Unity 3D
## About:
This is an unpolished proof-of-concept of implementing the motion, physics, and animation of casting a fishing rod and reeling in a fishing line in Unity 3D using Verlet Physics, Unity's Line, and other built-in physics elements.
Unity version used: LTS 2022.3.15f1

Values on the scripts can be finely tuned to get your desired physics behaviors in the Inspector.

## How to Observe the Behavior:
To view the behavior in this project, first, ensure that your character is not moving (this is due to how I set up the Animation Controller). You can change how this works in your own project.
- Press E to pull out your fishing rod.
- Left click to cast your fishing your fishing rod.
- Press Q to reel in your fishing rod.
